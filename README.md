# What is Version Control System?

- VCS or version control 
  - is a management system 
  - that tracks changes in a computer file.

- It is a software tool that records and manages changes 
  - to the source code over a period of time.

###### Q. imagine that you are working with your friend on a shared document and two of you are making changes in the file at the same time, what will happen? How will you track the change and mark the owner of the same? Or maybe you are working in a large team, how will you manage then?

- It helps developers to work efficiently.

### A version control system can do these for you
    - rollback and revert files back to a previous state or 
    - revert the entire project back to a previous state, 
    - compare changes over time, 
    - see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, 
    - who introduced an issue and when, and more, .

### Types of Version control

Basically there are three major types of VCS.

1. Local Version Control Systems
2. Centralized Version Control Systems
3. Distributed Version Control Systems
